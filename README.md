## 1. The application has multiple "views" or "pages" that exist at independent URLs. Feel free to use a routing lib like React Router to accomplish this.

## 2. A public api that returns an array of items. Responses are mapped over to create a summary display for each item. Some examples might be:

- List of APIS - https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

## Custom useForm hook to validate forms

## Private routes which can be accessed only by logged in users
